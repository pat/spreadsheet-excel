h1. Spreadsheet::Excel

I'm resurrecting this code from an old, no-longer-maintained gem (spreadsheet-excel). This is purely because I want something released using a permissive license that writes Excel files. I don't plan to maintain this library, but I'm just making a few small changes so I'm happy enough to use it.

h2. Installing

Given the gem already exists (and I'm not making any attempt to really take it over), the only way to install - short of getting the source and building the gem from the gemspec - is via Bundler.

<pre><code>gem 'spreadsheet-excel',
  :git    => 'git://github.com/freelancing-god/spreadsheet-excel.git',
  :branch => 'master'</code></pre>

h2. Usage

Have a read of the original README (@README.original.txt@), but keep in mind I've put all classes within the Spreadsheet::Excel namespace.

h2. Credits and Licence

As mentioned in the original README, this code is released under the Ruby licence. The original author was Daniel J. Berger, and the library was then maintained by Hannes Wyss.
